    "In this notebook, we aim to evluate the performance of \"GDSS\" proposed in \"Score-based Generative Modeling of Graphs via the System of Stochastic Differential Equations\" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02514.pdf). The baseline model is tested on 3 datasets (Grid, Protein, 3D Point Cloud) and measured under 4 metrics (degree, clustering, orbit, graph spectrum)."
