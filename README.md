# Experiments-on-Graph-Generative-Models
We aim to evaluate how well some popular graph generative models perform on several graph datasets.

## Progress:
- Currently working on "GDSS" proposed in "Score-based Generative Modeling of Graphs via the System of Stochastic Differential Equations" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02514.pdf). The baseline model are tested on **3** datasets (Grid, Protein, 3D Point Cloud) and measured under **4** metrics (degree, clustering, orbit, graph spectrum).
